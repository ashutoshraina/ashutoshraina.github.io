What are we doing ?
We are trying to create a snippet for creating an NUnit test.

How do we do this ?
We go write a snippet.

The snippet is here [Snippet](https://gist.github.com/4696972 "NUnit Snippet")

Save it under 
    
    ..\Documents\Visual Studio 2012\Code Snippets\Visual C#\My Code Snippets

Now go add the snippet.
Go to Tools in VS -&gt; Code Snippets Manager -&gt; and Import after clicking on the Snippet.
That's it, we are done.
