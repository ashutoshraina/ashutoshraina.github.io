Tools really make the ecosystem more productive. I list down some of the tools that I have found to be useful.

* Version Management
    
    We can have multiple version of ScriptCS installed on the system. Then to pick which one to use we can use the ScriptCS version Manager [SVM](https://github.com/scriptcs-contrib/svm)
    This is essentially similar to npm and helps keep track of different scriptcs versions.
    
* Running the code
    - Sublime Plugin :
        [Sublime Plugin](https://github.com/scriptcs/scriptcs-sublime) 
        
        It is a little dodgy on mac, windows will work just fine.
    - Atom Runner : 
        The wiki has a good guide on how to start with Atom and Scriptcs 
        [Atom](https://github.com/scriptcs/scriptcs/wiki/Running-scripts-in-Atom)
        I did struggle quite a bit with getting this to work neatly on mac initially things seem to be better now.
    
    - Omnisharp :
        One of the most active and loved .net projects. Omnisharp also has support for ScriptCS.
        [Omnisharp](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-atom)
        
This was a short tour of the tools and hopefully this gets you on your way.

With this we round up our tour of ScriptCS, it is a great project that continues to make little improvements to my every day workflow.
